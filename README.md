## Your-tour telegram bot 🚍🌍

### What is Your-tour bot❓

We will create a little helper for our clients - a telegram bot.

Why is Telegram? Most of the people who choose the bus tour are young people. This is more difficult for elders to endure long journeys in a seated position, very fast pace of excursions, night walks and lack of sleep. But young people put it off with a bang, they will not even notice how the 8 hours of the bus ride fly by.
 
When you buy a bus tour the most often doubts arise due to the fact that it is not known in which hotel you will stay for the night or how friendly the guide will come across. We've fixed that. Now you are the one who decides everything! After registering for the tour, about a week before the start, the bot will send you a quiz: in which hotel you would like to stay (the quiz is anonymous, of course), and which guide you would like to see. This way you can read hotel reviews, see photos and make a decision. The same situation is with the guide.
           
After the start of the tour, the assistant will always be with you, tell you the schedule of the day, at what place and at what time the general meeting, remind you of it with an alert, and give you weather data. Whatever you are late, the telegram bot will send you a notification 1 hour, 30 minutes and 15 minutes before the scheduled meeting time. With him you will always be in the know and save yourself from unnecessary worries.
            
During the tour, many varied and informative excursions await you, but what to do if you cannot hear the guide at all? No problem. The bot is happy to help you and will instantly provide textual support. You can go away to take a lovely photo without worrying about missing important information.
            
Our bot will always be with you, so less worry and more vivid impressions 😉
